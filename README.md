# Setup Instructions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
